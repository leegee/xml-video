<!-- 
    NB: Overlays are acheived by having multiple items in a sequence have the same start value, optionally setting the `blend`, `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` positions.

    Sequnce: a series of items in chronoligcal order; all items have to be in a sequence. Any item can contain any other item.
        
        * sequence
        * video
        * sound 
        * card

        All have properties as below: If not specified, they inherit the parent properties. If no ancestor has a particular attribute, it defaults to the subject's full duration, 
        
            * start: milliseconds by which to delay the start, relative to parent; defaults to 0, ie synced with the parent
            * duration: set to clip this and all children if any duration exceeds this figure. If not set, renders the whole file and any children. 
                * Cards render for the specified number of milliseconds, or so long as their parent is rendering.
            * width: see `height`
            * height: a percentage or pixel value to specify the dimension of the item
            * top: see `left`
            * left: a percentage or pixel value to specify the position of the item
            * alpha: alpha value of the media as a float between 0-1.
            * blend: blending mode for composition operation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation), defaults to `none`.
